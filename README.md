# An open-source - community built micro-inverter

![3D view](KiCAD_Files/renderings/3D.png)

## Manifesto 

The project goal are : 

- Having the first open source PV micro-inverter
- Finally a design easy to repair that is no longer a black box
- Redeem your data sovereignty, you will no longer depend on a proprietary cloud to follow your solar production and consumption. 

## Open, for everyone, forever

- This project is propulsed by its community. 
- The collective work generated is meant to remain open. 
- Design files are made with open source software - Namely kiCAD.
- Mechanical interfaces and components are modeled using FreeCAD.
- Simulation files use ngSpice.

In that sense, the owntech foundation aims at protecting this technical common.

## Control overview

![Control overview](Images/control_overview.png)

The control overview shows the uVerter as two coordinated stages: a PV-controlled DC/DC front end that regulates the panel operating point and raises the DC bus, followed by an AC control stage that shapes a grid-compliant AC output. Measurements and commands flow through Data I/O and the grid-compliance controller so the inverter can synchronize to line/neutral, limit harmonics, and maintain safe operation while power flows from the PV input to the grid.

## Firmware overview

The `firmware/src/main.cpp` file is the entry point for the uVerter firmware: it configures the sensors and power stages, sets up the real-time and background tasks, and runs the state machine plus control loops that drive the boost and inverter legs based on measurements and synchronization status.

- Real-time control runs in `loop_critical_task()` at 100 µs to read sensors, enforce protections, regulate the boost stage, compute duty cycles, and update grid-sync variables.
- Supervisory logic runs in `loop_application_task()` to manage modes (idle/startup/power/error), handle transitions, and expose telemetry through the user data API.

### Compiling

Micro-inverter uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) as it's build and dependency management system.

#### From the command line

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.

        python3 -m venv .owntech-venv
        source .owntech-venv/bin/activate

2. Install PlatformIO.

        pip3 install platformio

3. Compile the code. Dependencies (including Zephyr and Owntech libraries) are downloaded automatically.

        cd micro-inverter/firmware/
        pio run

#### In Visual Studio Code

1. Install the "PlatformIO IDE" extension
2. Open the `firmware` directory via PlatformIO's home screen (**not** with VSCode's File -> Open)
3. Press the "Build" button in the PlatformIO toolbar (found on the bottom left)

## Safety first  

### Disclaimer
This project is shared as-is, without any warranty of any kind, and without any guarantee of compliance with safety, EMC, or grid-connection regulations.
By building, modifying, or using this design, you accept full responsibility for verification, testing, certification (if applicable), and safe operation.

Do not connect a prototype to the public grid.
Grid connection must only happen after appropriate validation, protections, and (where required) third-party certification.

### Mind the risks  
Building a micro-inverter is an advanced DIY project. It combines high energy, high voltage, fast switching, and grid interaction — a mix that can injure, start fires, or damage property

Key hazards include:

- Electric shock and electrocution
Internal stages can reach hundreds of volts. Multiple nets are high voltage. Some capacitors can stay charged after power-off. Treat the system as live until proven discharged and measured.

- Fire and thermal runaway
Faults can turn traces, connectors, inductors, or semiconductors into heaters in seconds. Thermal issues can escalate quickly.

### A community note
We want this project to be open — not reckless. If you spot a safety issue (creepage/clearance, insulation, thermal margins, protection logic, connector ratings, etc.), please report it.
Safety improvements are contributions that protect everyone.
