# Contribute

This project is a technical common: open, repairable, auditable, and built by its community.  
Whether you bring careful eyes, lab time, code, documentation, or field experience — you’re welcome.

If you’re unsure where to start: open an issue, introduce yourself, and tell us what you’d like to work on.

## How to get involved

### 1) Pick a contribution path
Choose a topic below (Hardware / Firmware / Dataware). Each topic contains hands-on work items you can adopt.

### 2) Coordinate in public
Before starting large changes, please:
- Check existing issues / discussions
- Open a new issue describing your plan (scope + expected outcome)
- Share progress early (screenshots, measurements, logs)

This keeps effort aligned and avoids duplicated work.

### 3) Make a pull request
A good PR is small, reviewable, and documented:
- One clear purpose per PR
- Explain *what* changed and *why*
- Include screenshots for PCB/mechanical changes
- Include measurements / plots / logs when relevant
- Link the issue it addresses (e.g. `Fixes #123`)
